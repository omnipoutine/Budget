# Adriane Spence

## U.I. Design and Development.





Made with Gatsby, a React based open-source framework, using styled components and hosted on Netlify. This web application was designed with a minimal approach allowing the content to speak for itself.

To easily allow content to be published by Adriane, each project page and the about page is created dynamically using Markdown.
